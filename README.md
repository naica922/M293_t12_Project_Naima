# Module 293 Webseite Dokumentation

## Description of the assignment:
The task was to solve exercises with HTML and CSS. <br>
The knowledge you learnt or expanded was then applied in the project, which was individual work. br>
You were allowed to decide for yourself what the theme of the website should be and what the design should look like. <br>
There was a raster of guidelines and various resources for a good implementation. <br>

## My Idea:
At the beginning of this project, I spent a long time thinking about what my website should be about. <br>
I came up with several ideas, but I had to choose one. My ideas were a website for myself with a profile etc., a website for my uncle who gives special medical courses or a website for my cousin who is a designer. <br>
I chose the third idea because I had a lot of ideas for individual pages.<br>
After this step I visited other websites for inspiration and ideas for a design. <br>

my cousin invented "hot wire extensions" and is now active internationally.<br>
He already has a website, but I wanted to build my own for him because I do not really like his, but I am a fan of his design. 

## Realisation: 
For the project I created a mockup with draw.io and Wirefreames, which helped me with the realisation and an idea of how it should look.<br>
I invested a lot of time in these documents, but in the end it became even more complex because I realised that I didn't meet all the criteria. <br>
After that, I started with the realisation and continued it in class and at home.<br>

## Instructions for use:
If you want to view my website and the code you can follow these steps<br>
Vercel Link:<br>
https://m293-t12-project-naima-4t95.vercel.app/<br>

With the code:
1. clone from the repository<br>
2. open the code in your editor (e.g. VSC)<br>
3. download "Live Server" extension<br>
4. click on "live" at the bottom right of the IDE<br>
5. now a window should open in your browser and you will see the website :)<br>

## Automation:
I made my website automation with Vercel.<br>
If you want to view my website there, you will not see the CSS effects on the homepage, this is because Vercel does not automatically recognise the effects.<br>
So if you also want to see the effect then open it with VSC as described.<br>
