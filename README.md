# Module 293 Webseite Dokumentation

## Description of the assignment:
The task was to solve exercises with HTML and CSS. <br>
The knowledge you learnt or expanded was then applied in the project, which was individual work. br>
You were allowed to decide for yourself what the theme of the website should be and what the design should look like. <br>
There was a raster of guidelines and various resources for a good implementation. <br>

## My Idea:
At the beginning of this project, I spent a long time thinking about what my website should be about. <br>
I came up with several ideas, but I had to choose one. My ideas were a website for myself with a profile etc., a website for my uncle who gives special medical courses or a website for my cousin who is a designer. <br>
I chose the third idea because I had a lot of ideas for individual pages.<br>
After this step I visited other websites for inspiration and ideas for a design. <br>
