                <h2>About Fabio</h2>
                <h3>Hot Wire Extensions is a design studio based in Switzerland, lead by designer and material researcher Fabio Hendry.<br>
                Exploration and sustainability are central to our philosophy and the Hot Wire Extensions process is conceived with this in mind. <br>Using waste SLS 3D nylon powder, a material that is currently not recycled, and inspired by the way a vine grows around a tree,
                we reuse the material to create organic bone-like structures built around a wire.<br>
                We design and develop a diverse range of products, furniture and installations as well as bespoke commissions all characterised by our dedication to the mindful exploration of new material landscapes.

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <h3>Fabio Hendry is a Swiss designer whose work seeks to explore new potentials for overlooked matter –
                from architectural systems to materials. Hendry is interested in exploring disruptive approaches to industrial manufacturing,
                revealing alternative systems of production. It is his belief that design practices and ecological theories can be merged to allow
                us to critically consider our material landscape. Hendry is interested in the analysis of innovative and future industries and 
                takes inspiration from nature’s ability to adapt and reconstruct. His innovative products and hands-on experiments explore the boundaries
                between crafts and industry, ranging from furniture to sculptural objects and spatial installations.</h3>
